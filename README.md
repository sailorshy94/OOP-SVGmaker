# OOP SVG Maker

## Description
This project was created to take in user input that is submitted into the CLI and use it to generate an svg file with a logo inside. The user answers prompts in the command line in order to select the text (up to 3 letters), the text color, the shape type, and the shape color. Based on the answers to these parameters, the SVG is generated. This application uses Node.js to run, Inquirer to create a prompt module, fs to create a directory and file for the generated SVG, and Jest to run unit tests.
