# OOP SVG Maker

## Description
This project was created to take in user input that is submitted into the CLI and use it to generate an SVG file with a logo inside. The user answers prompts in the command line in order to select the text (up to 3 characters), the text color, the shape type (triangle, circle or square), and the shape color. Based on the answers to the parameters, the SVG is generated. This application uses Node.js to run, Inquirer to create a prompt module, fs to create a directory and file for the generated SVG, and Jest to run unit tests. This application also makes use of proper Javascript syntax and logical structure.
